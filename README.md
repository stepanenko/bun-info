# Bun

Bun is a JavaScript runtime, toolkit and Node.js-compatible package manager.

Bun lets us develop, test, run, and bundle JavaScript & TypeScript projects.

Bun provides a minimal set of highly-optimimized APIs for performing common tasks, like starting an HTTP server and writing files.

Bun is designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It natively implements hundreds of Node.js and Web APIs, including `fs`, `path`, `Buffer` and more.

The goal of Bun is to run most of the world's server-side JavaScript and provide tools to improve performance.

Install Bun v1.0.9:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
